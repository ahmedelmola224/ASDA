##  Video Game Sales Dataset

** Description:**  
This dataset contains information about global video game sales across different platforms and regions.  
It includes variables such as the game title, platform, release year, genre, publisher, and sales numbers in millions across North America, Europe, Japan, and other regions.

** Main Variables:**  
- `Name`: Title of the game  
- `Platform`: Console or device (e.g., PS4, Xbox, PC)  
- `Year`: Year of release  
- `Genre`: Type of game (Action, Sports, etc.)  
- `Publisher`: Game publisher  
- `NA_Sales`, `EU_Sales`, `JP_Sales`, `Other_Sales`, `Global_Sales`: Sales across different regions  

** Why I Chose It:**  
I’ve always been interested in gaming and how some games become global hits while others stay local favorites.  
I wanted to explore what factors (like genre or platform) might affect a game’s sales.  
This dataset gives me a chance to practice analyzing market trends using real numbers from an industry I actually enjoy following.

##  Extrovert vs Introvert Behavior Dataset

** Description:**  
This dataset explores the differences between extroverts and introverts based on their daily activities, social behavior, and time spent alone.  
It includes information about stage fright, event attendance, social media activity, and energy levels after socializing.

** Main Variables:**  
- `Time_spent_Alone`: Hours spent alone daily  
- `Stage_fear`: Presence of stage fright (Yes/No)  
- `Social_event_attendance`: Frequency of attending social events  
- `Going_outside`: How often the person goes outside  
- `Drained_after_socializing`: Feeling tired after socializing (Yes/No)  
- `Friends_circle_size`: Number of close friends  
- `Post_frequency`: How often they post on social media  
- `Personality`: Extrovert or Introvert  

** Why I Chose It:**  
I’ve always been curious about how personality traits shape people’s social behavior.  
This dataset seemed interesting because it connects data to something very human — how we interact with others.  
It also allows me to practice exploring correlations and comparing groups (introverts vs extroverts) in a meaningful way.

##  Heart Failure Prediction Dataset

** Description:**  
This dataset contains medical records used to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on clinical and lifestyle features.  
It includes health-related factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, and the presence of specific conditions related to cardiovascular health.

** Main Variables:**  
- `Age`: Patient’s age  
- `Sex`: Male or Female  
- `ChestPainType`: Type of chest pain  
- `RestingBP`: Resting blood pressure  
- `Cholesterol`: Cholesterol level  
- `FastingBS`: Fasting blood sugar  
- `MaxHR`: Maximum heart rate achieved  
- `ExerciseAngina`: Exercise-induced angina (Yes/No)  
- `Oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise  
- `ST_Slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment  
- `HeartDisease`: Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = normal)  

** Why I Chose It:**  
I chose this dataset because I’ve always been curious about how data can help improve healthcare decisions and predict diseases before they become serious.  
It’s smaller in size compared to other datasets, which makes it perfect for learning and practicing key statistical concepts.
